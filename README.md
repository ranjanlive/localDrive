## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Is my data secure when using LocalDrive?**  
A: Yes. LocalDrive only makes your files accessible on your local network. It doesn't expose them to the internet. The application doesn't send any data to external servers.

**Q: Can I access my files from outside my home network?**  
A: LocalDrive is designed for local network use only. If you need remote access, you would need to set up additional networking solutions like a VPN to your home network.

**Q: Does LocalDrive work on networks with multiple subnets?**  
A: By default, LocalDrive binds to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0). However, network routing between subnets might still be required depending on your network configuration.

**Q: Is there a mobile app version?**  
A: Currently, LocalDrive works through a web interface that's fully responsive and works well on mobile browsers. A dedicated mobile app might be developed in the future.
